Define standard output. This helped me to identify possible standard output that I know.

Confirmed that the standard output I know is actually considered standard output. Although provided, I did not bother looking at the code as I know how to use cout.

Build was producing an error I didn't fully understand. This helped me to recognise that my int function must return an int value. I adjusted my approach to the stack Top() function. I did go on to ask for some solutions but I didn't use any of them. I decided the simplest approach was best and did not include an isEmpty() check within the Top().

I needed to confirm my understanding of pointers to ensure my approach was correct. I used the code example to understand what the AI was explaining. I then applied this to my scenario.
