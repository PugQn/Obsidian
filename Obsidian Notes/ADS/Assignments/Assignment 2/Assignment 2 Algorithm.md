Use code from my tutorial answer

Consider reading in multi digit numbers
"Invalid" message is triggered when :
- too many numbers
- too many operators
- division by 0
- incorrect order of operators and numbers

Don't forget to 
- check for end of string issues
- put in error messages for invalid input
- null checks
