A data type where the first one in first one out (**FIFO**)

Basic operations:
- Join - new item to rear of queue
- Leave - remove item from front of queue
- Front - look at front item
- isEmpty - returns true if empty

If as an array: 
- **Front/rear variables** track the index of the beginning and end of the queue.
- **Creeping problem**: eventually the used elements in the array will creep towards the end of the array and eventually it will be out of scope of the array.
- **Circular array**: when the rear index reaches the end of the array it starts from the beginning of the array to add new items.
- Still limited to the size of the array.

If as a linked list: Front/rear pointers track the beginning and end of the queue.
