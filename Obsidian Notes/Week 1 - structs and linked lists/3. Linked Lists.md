Linked lists are like an array that doesn't live together. Each element in the list has its value and the address of the next element in the list. The last element has a null value for the next address.

This allows linked lists to be dynamic (shrink and grow as needed).

**Node** has data and pointer:

```
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *next;
};
```
