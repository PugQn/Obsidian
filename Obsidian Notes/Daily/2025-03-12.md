Waited all morning to see if Darryl would get back to me. She didn't. Perhaps I need to go into MASH to get things moving.

Did not go to tutorial. Wasn't ready for it. Caught up with ADS instead. Managed to have a look at the assignment. Not too hard. Am going to look at it in the morning.

Went to body balance and then the gym. Used the new technogym app. Need to get back into the gymming.
