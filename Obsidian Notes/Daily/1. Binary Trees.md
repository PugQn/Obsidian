Decision tree with only two options at each choice.

A **full binary** **tree** is where every node has zero or two children.
A **complete binary** **tree** is where every branch goes up to the same level.

**Terms**:
- **Node**: Item in a tree
- **Branch**: Link between nodes
- **Root**: First node
- **Leaf**: Last node
- **Parent**: previous node
- **Child**: Next node
- **Siblings**: Nodes with same parent node
- **Levels**: Layers of the tree structure, generation, root is level 1
- **Height**: numbers of levels in a tree
- **Null tree**: no levels.
- **Forest**: Many trees, set of trees
- **Subtree**: a branch of a tree


## Traversal
The order of the branches of a tree are important.

**Pre-order traversal**: Will produce A B C D E F
**In-order traversal**: Will produce B A D C E F
**Post-Order**: B D E C F A

Black edges (left sibling) represents a child relationship.
Red edges (right sibling) represents a sibling relationship.
