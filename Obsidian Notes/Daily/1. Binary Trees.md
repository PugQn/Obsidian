Decision tree with only two options at each choice.

A **full binary** **tree** is where every node has zero or two children.
A **complete binary** **tree** is where every branch goes up to the same level.

**Terms**:
- **Node**: Item in a tree
- **Branch**: Link between nodes
- **Root**: First node
- **Leaf**: Last node
- **Parent**: previous node
- **Child**: Next node
- **Siblings**: Nodes with same parent node
- **Levels**: Layers of the tree structure, generation, root is level 1
- **Height**: numbers of levels in a tree
- **Null tree**: no levels.
- **Forest**: Many trees, set of trees
- **Subtree**: a branch of a tree


## Traversal
The order of the branches of a tree are important.

Traversal functions


### Pre-order traversal: 
Prints before checking children.
Will produce A B C D E F


```
void inOrder(Tree* T) {
	if (T == NULL) { return; }
	cout << T->RootData();i
	nOrder(T->Left());
	inOrder(T->Right());
}
```

- Print the node as it gets to it.
- Follows down the left node each time, until leaf.
- Then addresses right node, backing up towards the initial node.

### In-order traversal: 
Prints after checking left. then checks right
Will produce B A D C E F

```
void inOrder(Tree* T) {
	if (T == NULL) { return; }
	inOrder(T->Left());
	cout << T->RootData();
	inOrder(T->Right());
}
```

- Use a stack to keep track of which node called the traversal function and whether it was the first traversal call or the second.

### **Post-Order**:
Will produce B D E C F A
Prints after checking both sides.
```
void inOrder(Tree* T) {
	if (T == NULL) { return; }
	inOrder(T->Left());
	inOrder(T->Right());
	cout << T->RootData();
}
```



## General Tree to Binary Tree

General Tree:

Can be converted to this binary tree:

Black edges (left sibling) represents a child relationship.
Red edges (right sibling) represents a sibling relationship.
