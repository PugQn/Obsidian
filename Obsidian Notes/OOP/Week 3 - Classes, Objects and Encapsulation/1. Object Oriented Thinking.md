OOP not the only way to program. Alternatives:
- procedural: Series of operations to execute

In OOP, Each object has it's own relationships and behaviours.
Advantages:
 - Code reusability

## Object
Bundle of 
- attributes (what they are) or state (how they are), and 
- behaviour (what they can do).

Some objects can contain other objects.

## Class
The abstract description of a group of objects.

To create an object you need to first create the class. These can also be provided by a library or framework.
