## Creating Objects
When creating a new object you ***must*** follow this structure:
`className variableName = new constructor(value1, value2);`

- Declaration: Class name and the name of your new object.
- Instantiation: `new`
- Initialisation: The constructor (which is usually the same name as the class. I.e., `class Stack` will have constructor `Stack()` ) and the arguments which set the values for any data the object holds on initialisation.

If you do not follow above, and declare a variable without instantiating it (`new`) then the variable will point to a null. `new` produces a reference to an object but not the object itself. The constructor does that.

Only primitive data types can be instantiated without the use of `new`.

## Automatic Memory Management
Java automatically manages the memory being used. If a variable is dereferenced or set to null then the memory is deallocated (garbage collection). You cannot force garbage collection as it is managed by the VM. There is no way to force the deletion of objects


## this
refers to the current class. Must be used to call on any member variables or methods within the class.

## Controlling access to members of class

Always use the most restrictive access level possible, considering the situation.



## Class variables
### `Static` modifier:
class wide variables. Every instance of the class has this variable and can modify it. The static variable exists within the class itself, outside of any objects.

e.g.
```
public class Bicycle {

//Other member variables and methods

private static int numberOfBicycles = 0;
}
```

This can then be called like this: `Bicycle.numberOfBicycles`

This is useful when you are trying to keep track of the number of things. Include and incrementation in the constructor.

### `final` modifier
same as static but it cannot be changed.
These are constants.
Naming convention is all caps with underscores: `VAR_NAME`
## Class methods
You can also have `static` methods. This means the function is accessible by all, and can exist without any instances (objects) of the class itself.

```
public static int getNumberofBicycles {
	return numberofBicycles;
}
```

You call it like this: `ClassName.methodName(args)`

## The "Object" class
All classes created are a subclass. If a parent-class is not given then it becomes a child of the "Object" class.

The "Object" class is the only class that is not a sub-class. It has methods that can be inherited by subclasses.
- `toString()` : returns a value of type String representing the object requested. The original object is converted. If you were to call `toString(anObject)` then it would return a string of the object full class name and location in memory.
You can override inherited methods to produce something more useful.
