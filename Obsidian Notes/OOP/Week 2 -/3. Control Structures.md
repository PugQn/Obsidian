Structure types:
- Sequence: statements are executed in order written.
- Selection: if, if-else, nested if, ? operators and switch statements
	- enable change of sequence
- Repetition: sentinel-controlled, counter-controlled, for, while, do-while
- Branching statements: break, continue, return, exit.

## Braces
You only need braces (curly brackets) if there is more than 1 line of code within the selection type. It is safer to always use braces.

## Switch statements
Use break only when you want to stop comparing for other statements. If break is not used then the other statements will be compared too.

## Ternary Operators
Short hand if statement
`expression ? op1 : op2`
If the expression is true then op1. If false then op2.

e.g.
```
String result = value % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd";
```

## do...while loops
A `while` loop will only execute if the precondition is valid:
```
while (counter < 11) {
	do this command;
	counter ++;
}
```
This means that the command may not ever run if the counter >11

A `do ... while` loop will run the command once and only repeat if the condition is valid.
```
 do {
	do this command;
	counter ++;
} while (counter < 11);
```


## break & continue

`break` moves execution to the end of the current block.

`continue` finishes the current loop of the current block and brings execution to top og current block.
