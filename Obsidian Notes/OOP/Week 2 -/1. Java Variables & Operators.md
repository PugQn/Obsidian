Java is "statically typed" = all variables must be declared before use.
In Java, there are only 2 data types:
- **Primitive data types:**
	- They are the only types that can be declared as local or stack variables
	- Built into language and cannot be created.:
		- byte = 8bit
		- short = 16 bit
		- int = 32 bit
		- float = 32 bit (needs `f` at end of value as comp assumes double)
		- long = 64 bit (needs `l` at end of value as comp assumes int)
		- double = 64 bit
		- bool = true/false
		- char = 16 bit Unicode (can be assigned the Unicode value of the char. I.e., 'a' or 97 )
	- **Literal** : 
		- fixed value at beginning but can change during prog
		- set at beginning of prog, 
		- uses any of above data types.
- **Objects:**
	- can only be created by using `new` command.

## Naming conventions
- Use caMel case
- Good practice to assign value at prototyping/initialisation.
- can be assigned to the value of another variable: `int a = b;`

## Escape sequences
May be used in any string or char

## Scope
There are no global variables in Java. All variables must be defined within a class or methods of the class.

**Data Members**: Variables declared in a class as data members of that class.

Prototype/declare the variable as close to the first use as possible.

## Promotion
When multiplying variables data types will change to the larger data type. 

E.g., int * long = will produce long
or float * double  = will produce double

## Type Casting
**Implicit casting**: increasing the type size (byte -> double)
**Explicit casting**: decreasing the type size (double -> byte)
