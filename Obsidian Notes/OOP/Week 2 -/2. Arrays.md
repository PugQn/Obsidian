Same as C++.

An error will occur if the index used is beyond the bounds of the array.

Is a **reference type**

## Declaring the array

```
int[] array;            // Declare the array (not created yet)
array = new int [3]     // Create the array. This one hold 3 elements.
```

Type of data stored in array is limited to that in the declaration.

## Initialising the array

Can be done as above code block or as below
```
int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5}
```
This allows the size of the array to match the values input.

## Length
`array.length` = produces length of the array.

## Copying arrays
The recieving array must be the same shape (data type or object) as the sending array. It must also be at least as large, so that there is space for all elements to be received.
