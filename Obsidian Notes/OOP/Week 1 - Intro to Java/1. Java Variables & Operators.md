Java is "statically typed" = all variables must be declared before use.
In Java, there are only 2 data types:
- Primitive data types:
	- They are the only types that can be declared as local or stack variables
	- Built into language and cannot be created. (int, float, char,)
- Objects:
	- can only be created by using `new` command.
