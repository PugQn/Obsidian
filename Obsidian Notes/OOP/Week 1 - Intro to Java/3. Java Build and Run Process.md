#### Classpath

The classpath enables compiler to know where to place the .class file created and the Java VM to find the .class files when running the program.

As default, the classpath is set to the current directory. Packages can be used to structure a larger program.

##### Naming Rules

**Package name**: The first part of the name is the package path. It is like a file path but `\` become `.`

I.e., `com.example.file.path`.

It is always in lower case. These are hierarchical like filepaths.


**Simple name**: The second part is the simple name or name of the program and program file. This is always in PascalCase.

I.e., `ProgramName`


**Fully qualified name**: The whole thing together is the entire path to the program.

I.e., `com.example.file.path.ProgramName`


Classes are stored in directories matching their naming conventions.

##### Compiling using classpath

By default, the compiler will put .class files in the same folder as the source file. If this is not the same as the package name in the java program then the .class file will not be found.

When compiling to a specific folder use

`javac -d . MyProgram.java`

`-d` tells the compiler to create/find the directory in the path specified.

`.` from the current directory

##### Running using classpath

If the .class file is not in you current folder the you need to provide the fully qualified name to call it.

I.e., `java com.example.file.path.ProgramName`

##### Setting the classpath

The class path is defaulted to your current directory. But it can be set to indicate the project Â root folder. This means that you can run calls from anywhere.

1. Check existing classpath: `SET CLASSPATH`
2. Set classpath to project root folder: `SET CLASSPATH=C:\path\to\project\root\folder`

To reset classpath: `SET CLASSPATH=`
