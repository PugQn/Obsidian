### Question 1

*What is the difference between a "compiler" and an "interpreter"?*

Compiler: interprets the program into machine code and executes the program, all at once.

Interpreter: interprets the program into machine code and executes the program, one instruction at a time.

### Question 2

*If you have the source code for a Java program, and you want to run that program, you will need both a compiler and an interpreter. What does the Java compiler do, and what does the Java interpreter do?*

Compiler: interprets the program into bytecode.

Interpreter: reads the bytecode and executes the program.

### Question 3
*Java is a "platform-independent language." What does this mean?*

Java runs using the JRE (Java Run-time Environment) which is like a virtual machine that processes the program independently of the physical system. This allows any Java program to run regardless of the platform it is being run on.

This is subject to the machine being able to interpret Bytecode. Essentially, the JRE allows the platform to skip the compilation phase.
