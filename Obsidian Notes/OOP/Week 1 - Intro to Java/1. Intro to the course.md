Popularity is judged by:
- use in lots of programs
- by lots of developers
- and an active community
- and significant job market.

Low level languages are close to machine code, which means it is more difficult to write, and less like natural language.

### Structured vs. OOP

OOP is when you consider what the key objects/components are in the problem and then how they interact and what their relationships are., Changes do not require much as objects and/or their relationships are just reconfigured.

Structured programming is when the problem is broken down into smaller problems and each small part is programmed and then joined into a larger solution. Tends to be inflexible and hard to change.
